          <strong>What's been happening? What‚Äôs next?</strong> Those are the two questions I have
          when I open Basecamp. Today's Home screen doesn't answer them right away. I click into
          projects. Scan the Activity page. What if the answers were right there, on the cards, at a
          glance?
        </p>

        <p class="push_half--top">
          <strong>Why not a full redesign?</strong> Basecamp's Home is warm. Inviting. Most other
          products feel like data-tables on steroids. Cold and sterile. That's not Basecamp. I
          didn't want to lose that.
        </p>

        <p class="push_half--top">
          <strong>So I focused on the cards.</strong> What if they were just a little more dynamic?
          Helpful, not busy. Enough to answer those two questions. Customizable, with a click.

              After refining the affordance, I pushed on refining a few sections in the card.
              Leaning towards the preview style of content, like the cards in a project's main page.
              I talked with Isa and we thought I could further refine the updates in the cards with
              language and copy. For example, instead of showing the checkbox checked, it could say
              "Isa completed [task name]." Time permitting, I'll tackle that tomorrow as a "Nice to
              have".
            </li>
            <li class="push--top">
              I also did a quick hook up with JS (and Cursor), so that it saves the card states and
              preferences in local storage, to get a better feel what it would be like coming back
              to the Home screen and seeing the projects at a glance.

              Made focused progress on the prototype. Hooked up the ‚ÄúAt a glance‚Äù knob on the card
              and built out the todo list preview. Sketched the remaining knob states for the other
              views.
            </li>

            <li class="push_half--top">
              Playing with the live knob sparked a new idea: Let users control the card size ‚Äî not
              just 16:9, but different levels of density. Mocked it up in code. I'll refine the menu
              tomorrow.
