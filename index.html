              Recorded a quick video of the “At a glance” cards in action.
              Stitched it together using the Inspector and a quick Figma
              prototype. I’m liking the knob concept—like tuning into your
              favorite station. Old-school, nostalgic, playful, and fun.

              Made solid progress on the prototype shell. Built the header,
              buttons, and first card. Tomorrow I’ll apply the grid layout, then
              dive into the knob and card content.

              Talked to Isa about the "At a glance" cards. We both agreed: we
              care more about "what happened" and "what's on deck" — than what
              we personally did. We already know that part.

              Started sketching the prototype concept for

              Moved the Basecamp project into a separate project for the
              exercise.

              Upgraded my Basecamp account to support multiple projects. Invited
              my wife, Isa, to collaborate on home projects and observed how
              updates and assignments show up for each person.
            </li>

            <li class="push_half--top">
              Initialized the project repo, published it, and set up a
              subdomain:
              <a href="https://basecamp-home.ndan.works"
                >basecamp-home.ndan.works</a

            <li class="push_half--top">
              Started adding basic styles — mostly variables — to the repo.
              Pulled a few values directly from Basecamp’s production code using
              the inspector.

              Jotted down more rough ideas and notes in the

              This week I’m tackling the at-home exercise. Evolving the Basecamp
              home screen from a static project launcher into something more
              dynamic. Answering: “What’s been happening across my projects?”,
              "What's on deck?" The goal: work for both cases—one project or
              many happening at once.

              Prepped the Basecamp project. Set up todos around logistics,
              created a temp changelog doc, and imported the brief as a

            <li class="push_half--top">
              Started framing the problem. What questions should this solution
