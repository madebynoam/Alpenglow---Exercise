            <li class="push--top">
              After refining the affordance, I pushed on refining a few sections
              in the card. Leaning towards the preview style of content, like
              the cards in a project's main page. I talked with Isa and we
              thought I could further refine the updates in the cards with
              language and copy. For example, instead of showing the checkbox
              checked, it could say "Isa completed [task name]." Time
              permitting, I'll tackle that tomorrow as a "Nice to have".
            </li>
            <li class="push--top">
              I also did a quick hook up with JS (and Cursor), so that it saves
              the card states and preferences in local storage, to get a better
              feel what it would be like coming back to the Home screen and
              seeing the projects at a glance.

              Made focused progress on the prototype. Hooked up the “At a
              glance” knob on the card and built out the todo list preview.
              Sketched the remaining knob states for the other views.
            </li>

            <li class="push_half--top">
              Playing with the live knob sparked a new idea: Let users control
              the card size — not just 16:9, but different levels of density.
              Mocked it up in code. I'll refine the menu tomorrow.

              Realized I could’ve just turned on Automatic Check-ins in the
              Basecamp project 🙈 — instead of building this log from scratch.
              No worries. Glad I’ve been journaling along the way.

              Recorded a quick video of the “At a glance” cards in action.
              Stitched it together using the Inspector and a quick Figma
              prototype. I’m liking the knob concept—like tuning into your
              favorite station. Old-school, nostalgic, playful, and fun.

              Made solid progress on the prototype shell. Built the header,

              Talked to Isa about the "At a glance" cards. We both agreed: we
              care more about "what happened" and "what's on deck" — than what
              we personally did. We already know that part.
